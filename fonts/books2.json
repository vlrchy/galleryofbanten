Please make sure your RPG Maker MV \nsoftware is up to date before using this plugin.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nWhen we create a game, we usually create a whole \nnew world rich in lore and details, and want to \nmake it all available to the players, so that they \ncan understand every single detail we develop. \nHowever, just dumping it all in lengthy dialogues \nusually bore and scare most of the players, who \nwill simply give up on your world.\n\nA common alternative used by many AAA games is to \nminimize dialogue and exposition, and provide \nadditional details through in-game books.\n\nThis plugin aims to provide just that for your \ngame: a book menu where the player can read up \nadditional lore when he feels up to it. You can \nplace books throughout your game, providing a bit \nmore of context for hungry players as they \nprogress, and keeping exposition to a minimum.",
